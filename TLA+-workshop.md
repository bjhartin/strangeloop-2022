# TLA+ (Temporal Logic of Actions) Workshop

## Summary

TLA+ is a formal method of checking desired properties of distributed services during design.  It has enjoyed success at Microsoft and Amazon.  TLA+ expands on predicate logic, meaning we describe desired behavior using the familiar:

- Boolean AND, OR, NOT
- For all ...
- There exists ...
- Predicates which combine these

TLA+ adds logical operators that describe time:

- Eventually
- Always

So we can write things like:

"For all users (u), eventually there exists a registration (r) where r.name == u.name and r.email == u.email"
