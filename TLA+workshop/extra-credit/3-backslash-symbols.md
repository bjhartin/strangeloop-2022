So why is ∀x∈S written `\A x \in S` and not the much more legible format, `all x in S`? TLA+ is rather unique here; most other formal languages use English terms instead of backslashy things.

There's two things here. First of all, Leslie Lamport invented TLA+ in 1994, and originally intended it as a *handwritten notation* for studying systems. He wasn't expecting people to want to type it, and he **never** expected people to model check it! Obviously, when handwriting, you're not restricted to typing ASCII symbols and can just write `∀`. 

Second of all, LaTeX stands for "Lamport's TeX".




Yes, the same guy invented TLA+ and LaTeX. Lamport has had a very, very long career.
